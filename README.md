# Just messing around with the camera and dot matrix displays in Python.


# Camera program that uses the webcam to create a retro camera effect.
# The program uses Pygame and OpenCV to capture the webcam feed and render it as a dot matrix display.
# The user can adjust the dot size, spacing, color, frame rate, and visual effect using keyboard controls.
# The program also includes a control panel with instructions and a stats panel to display the current settings.
# The user can take screenshots of the display by pressing the 'S' key.
